                    <p>Both with individual musical journeys, producers Nick and Damien are an unlikely
                        pairing. Nick has previously played bass for experimental ska band Naked Squid, and
                        prog rock band Winterwood. Damien, a techno DJ since 2000 and in more recent years a
                        producer under the moniker Dorbachov , has released on various underground labels
                        such as Renasanz Records, Forte Techno, Gobsmacked Records and Clutch Trax.
                        Damien’s career in techno has seen him remix the official theme music of Channel 4’s
                        cult drama ‘Utopia’, released to mark the final episode of the first series.</p>
                    <p>The duo met outside of music, working together in 2013. It wasn’t long before their
                        shared passion for underground electronic music saw them hitting the clubs of the
                        exploding London bass house scene. In 2014 the pairing decided to get in the studio
                        together, initially as Hot Knives, under which alias they released a remix on 18-09
                        Records of the much-acclaimed upfront house track ‘The Spark Inside’ by Jon Hatter.
                        This exclusive remix found its way onto the Glamorous Club Grooves compilation in July
                        2016.</p>
                    <p>With a natural love and appreciation for music across genres and the ability to embrace
                        bleeding edge technology, the pair set to work on carving out a unique sound that
                        blends and pushes the boundaries of genre and classification.</p>
                    <p>Having had a stint of successful shows on Flo Radio, the friend’s studio chemistry
                        evolved and flourished in the live performance environment, AnD/oR went on to make
                        their festival debut in August 2016 at Hamswell Festival in Somerset, UK. This saw them
                        on the same bill as The Scratch Perverts and DJ Vadim, setting the bar on the opening
                        night of the festival. The pair are now back in the studio, putting the finishing touches to
                        their first wave of EPs.</p>
