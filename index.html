                       <p>Simon Foran: Nihilus EP</p>
                       <p>Irish techno producer Simon Foran has put a lot of hard work into learning the art and science of 
                           sound and music technology; his studies have included spending two years honing his craft under the m
                           entorship of Will Kinsella (Hybrasil) (Kombination Research, Loose Records, Bush Records).
                        </p>
                            
                        <p>Since dropping his debut EP: "Nexus" on Dream Mode in November 2014, Simon has followed up with 2015's 
                            "Daumenatron", and 2016's 'Etymology' both on Dewing Records. Simon rounded off 2016 with his acclaimed 
                            'Cybersex' EP on Portugal's Toxic Recordings, charting at number 6 in the Hard Techno top 100 releases.    
                        </p>
                            
                        <p>Not one to rest on his laurels, Foran is constantly in the studio pushing his boundaries with a distinct 
                            ear for detail. He has been moulding his dark melodic sound, a sound he showcases on his latest two track EP: 
                            Nihilus, released September 28th on Distrackt Records.
                        </p>
                            
                        <p><strong>Nihilus - </strong>Starting with a sinister/ evil style pad with an acid growling bass building up in 
                            the background, touches of infectious perc's and stab's throughout the track with an eerie synth sounding voice. 
                            With a driven melodic synth stab lead with a sinister twist. A hard hitter with a feeling of your been followed/ 
                            chased, always creeping up behind you.
                        </p>
                            
                        <p><strong>Filtered Hound - </strong>A contagious rolling bass building with a synth stab carrying it with a warm pad 
                            underneath. Beautiful break's with a hands in the air vibe. Melodic lead synth been introduced to a building synth 
                            drone/ sequence bringing it in with its heavy kick and infectious hats.

                    <p>Deviate: Satellite EP</p>
                    <p>
                        Deviate is the combination of two techno producers that have joined forces in the
                        summer of 2016. They have developed a distinct sound from many months locked away
                        in the studio. Their debut Ep was signed to Amsterdam based Label Egothermia Records
                        and was released at the end of April 2017. The pair have many more productions in the
                        pipe line due to hit stores in the coming months.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Their second release Satellite on Diagnostic Records finds the duo in impressive form, a
                        two-track statement of determination.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Satellite - </strong> A warm growling pad is keeping steady movement throughout the track,
                        moving smoothly into a light melodic breakdown, slowly building airy suspense before
                        dropping us straight into a hard hitting, warehouse filling, melodic ensemble of rides,
                        hats and storming pads.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Need You Here - </strong>A cool steady rhythm carries us through the arrangement with varied
                        percussion and a quirky baseline drawing us further into the track. Again a warm
                        growling sound carries us into a more energetic part of the track, with lots of groove
                        and rhythm. It then eases into an eerie vocal breakdown with a crisp breakbeat pattern,
                        before dropping back in on a smooth synth stab only to close out with plenty of rhythm
                        and energy.
                    </p>

                        <p>Their debut release Mind Map finds the duo in stunning form, a
                        three-track statement of intent.</p>
                        <p><strong>All Your's - </strong>A deep rumbler that takes us on a journey through a sonic landscape of
                        chambered percussion and modulated grooves never taking an eye off the past whilst
                        looking to the future.</p>
                        <p><strong>Aperture - </strong>A hypnotic rollercoaster likened to a locomotive layered on a warm bassy
                        groove. The main synth hook is otherworldly whilst being complemented by
                        earthbound metallic stabs and orchestral strings.</p>
                        <p><strong>Eleven - </strong>Emotions run high as layers of luscious motive synths give a nod to the genesis
                        of the electronic age in this peak time big room aural trip that leaves us simultaneously
                        grounded and ungrounded.</p>
