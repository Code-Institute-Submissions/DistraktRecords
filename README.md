## Synopsis
This project is designed to be the website for a new independent record label
called Distrackt Records. The site is supposed to showcase the artwork and music
of all the bands/artists on the label, be a place to find out news pertaining to 
the label (release dates etc) and be a place where people can contact the label from.

## Motivation 
Distrackt Records wanted the site to be clean and functional in it's navigation while 
having a dark, gritty and industrial feel to the design that reflects the tone of the music.

The main focus of the site is the releases page as this showcases all the music the record 
label offers. The songs are available to stream freely and have links to where the music can 
be purchased. The audio player I built on this page is intended to be added to as the label grows
and more music becomes available. It is designed to be easy to use, yet eye-catching at the 
same time. The idea is to make the releases page be a place that people want to visit and listen 
to music on.

Later on, the website will include e-commerce sections to buy music directly from the site itself
and we plan to add a live podcast radio section to the audio player on the site. These will come
into being over the next 6 - 12 months.

   Dependencies |  Reason for Use
--------------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bootstrap       |   Used for it's responsivity, ease of building navigation and quick styling.
jQuery          |   Used for the the animation effects on the home page and for the changing images on the releases page
amplitude js    |   Used to build the audio player on the releases page. Amplitude handles all the playback and playlist functionality that make the releases page work as a full audio player.
